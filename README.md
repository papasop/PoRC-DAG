# PoRC-DAG Prototype

A prototype implementation of the PoRC-DAG (Proof of Resonant Consistency for DAGs) structure-driven consensus protocol.

This system replaces traditional PoW/PoS models with structure-based consensus, where nodes are rewarded for contributing to a verifiable structure path within a DAG, based on private structure functions, residual thresholds, and entropy diversity.

## ðŸ”§ Modules

### `phi.py`
- Generates a node-specific structure function Ï†(x) from a seed.
- Computes Ï†(x) and its residual Î´(x) = |Ï†(x) âˆ’ Ï„| for a given anchor Ï„.

### `zkp.py`
- Simulates a zero-knowledge proof to check if Î´(x) < Îµ.
- Placeholder for future integration with Bulletproofs or zk-SNARKs.

### `dag.py`
- Manages DAG nodes, structure signature storage, and reference edges.

### `svm.py`
- Simulates a Structure VM to validate structure paths (Ïˆ-paths) using residual monotonicity and entropy consistency.

### `reward.py`
- Calculates structure weights w(S) based on reference count, residual precision, and entropy diversity.

### `simulate.py`
- Runs a complete simulation of node submissions, structure generation, and DAG evolution.
